# ATT Soundpack: Gnome
This AddOn provides a soundpack for All The Things and changes:

- Fanfare sounds when collecting new things;
- RareFind sound when a rare item is collected.

These sounds are the in-game sounds for gnomes cheering. Simple and minimalistic, it keeps the overall fanfare and noise pollution of ATT to a minimum - but with entertaining confirmations of achievements still intact.

The purpose of this AddOn is to both serve as an actual soundpack, as well asÂ an example for others to create their own soundpacks for All The Things.

This AddOn has no affiliation with the dependent AddOn, All The Things. This addon was inspired by ATTSoundpackChiptune.lua.
